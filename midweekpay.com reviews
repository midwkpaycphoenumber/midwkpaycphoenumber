Borrowers in states with no rate caps—Idaho, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin—pay  the highest prices in the country, more than double those paid by residents of several states with interest rate limits, such as Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, and Oregon.

States with high or no rate limits tend to have the most payday loan stores per capita.1 (See Figure 2.) But in states with lower rate limits, payday credit is not significantly constrained; instead, fewer stores simply serve more customers each.2 For example, in the three years after Colorado lowered permissible interest rates for payday loans, half of stores closed; but each remaining store served 80 percent more customers. Borrowers' access to credit in the state was virtually unchanged.3 In the 15 states  that prohibit payday lending or interest rates higher than 36 percent, there are no payday lending stores.
